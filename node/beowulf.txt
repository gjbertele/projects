tram Beowulf
translated by Charles W. Kennedy
The tale of Beowulf's adventures begins with the legendary Scyld,
founder of the Danish royal line. Sailing alone over the sea, the child
Scyld mysteriously comes to the Danish people. As a young man he leads
them through a series of battles in which they capture the mead-halls of
surrounding tribes, subduing them and forcing them to pay tribute to the
Danes. Thus Scyld establishes a pattern for success as a ruler. At his death
the Danes return him to his mysterious source, setting his body, amid a
heap of the treasures he has won, adrift at sea.
The Danish Court and the Raids of Grendel
Lo! we have listened to many a lay
Of the Spear-Danes' 1 fame, their splendor
of old,
Their mighty princes, and martial deeds!
Many a mead-hall Scyld, son of Sceaf,2
s Snatched from the forces of savage foes.
From a friendless foundling, feeble and
wretched,
He grew to a terror as time brought change.
He throve under heaven in power and pride
Till alien peoples beyond the ocean
10 Paid toll and tribute. A good king he! .
'Tis by earning honor a man must rise
In every state. Then his hour struck,
And Scyld passed on to the peace of God.
As their leader had bidden, whose word
was law
15 In the Scylding realm3 which he long had
ruled,
His loving comrades carried him down
To the shore of ocean; a ring-prowed ship,
Straining at anchor and sheeted with ice,
Rode in the harbor, a prince's pride.
10 The Anglo-Saxons
20 Therein they laid him, their well-loved lord,
Their ring-bestower, in the ship's embrace,
The mighty prince at the foot of the mast
Amid much treasure and many a gem
From far-off lands. No lordlier ship
25 Have I ever heard of, with weapons heaped,
With battle-armor, with bills and byrnies.4
On the ruler's breast lay a royal treasure
As the ship put out on the unknown ·deep.
With no less adornment they dressed him
round
1. Spear-Danes. The poet supplies the Danish people with
various epithets (descriptive names) in the course of the
poem, partly to help his lines alliterate, and perhaps partly as an attempt at characterization. In addition to "SpearDanes," he calls them "Ring-Danes" and "Bright-Danes," as well as "South-," "East-," and "West-Danes."
2. Scyld (shild), son of Sceaf (shat), founder of the Danish line of kings, the Scyldingas, "descendants of Scyld."
The Danish people are also referred to as "Scyldings."
Scyld's name means "Shield, son of Sheaf," or perhaps
"Shield with a sheaf."
3. Scylding realm, Denmark.
4. bills and byrnies, swords and shirts of chain mail.

Whereby God punished the grievous guilt
Of Abel's murder. Nor ever had Cain
Cause to boast of that deed of blood;

5. folk-land, common land (the public land owned by the
community). Germanic tribal law reserved this land for
grazing .
6. Hall of the Hart, Heoroi (h:3.'d rot), Hrothgar's meadhall. The hart (or stag) was a symbol of Germanic kingship.
The head of the scepter found at Sutton Hoo (see pages
42-43) was a stag.
7. honi-gabled, perhaps with roof ornaments carved to
resemble a stag's antlers, or perhaps simply "wide-gabled."
8. scop's sweet song. The scop (skop) was the tribe's storyteller, chanting his tales to the sound of the harp.
9. seed of Cain. In Genesis, Cain murders his brother
Abel and is driven into the wilderness by God. According
to legend his offspring included a variety of monsters. The
poet mentions eotenas, "etans" (cannibal giants like trolls),
ylfe "elves," (beautiful but evil), and orc-neas, "goblins"
(animated corpses like zombies). Grendel may have been a creature of this last type (see Comment on page 12).
Beowulf 11 
The war-might of Grendel was widely
known.
Mirth was stilled by the sound of weeping;
The wail of the mourner awoke with day.
And the peerless hero, the honored prince, 10
,o Weighed down with woe and heavy of heart,
Sat sorely grieving for slaughtered thanes,11
As they traced the track of the cursed
monster.
From that day onward the deadly feud
Was a long-enduring and loathsome strife.
95 Not longer was it than ~ne night later
The fiend returning renewed attack
With heart firm-fixed in the hateful war,
Feeling no rue for the grievous wrong.
'Twas easy thereafter to mark the men
100 Who sought their slumber elsewhere afar,
Found beds in the bowers, since Grendel's
hate
Was so baldly blazoned in baleful signs.
He held himself at a safer distance
Who escaped the clutch of the demon's claw.
10s So Grendel raided and ravaged the realm,
One against all, in an evil war
The Nature of Grendel
Grendel's nature is, of course, diabolical from
a Christian point of view: he is a member of
the race of Cain, from whom all misshapen and
unnatural beings were spawned, such as ogres
and elves. He is a creature dwelling in the outer
darkness, a giant, a cannibal. When he crawls off
to die, he is said to join the rout of devils in Hell.
However, he also appears to have roots in Scandinavian folklore. In Old Norse literature, monsters of his type make their appearance chiefly as
draugar, 1 or animated corpses. They are ordinary
folk who have been buried upright in cairns,2
according to Norse custom, but if they harbor
a grievance after death they will refuse to stay
• put and will roam about at night wreaking aim12 The Anglo-Saxons
Till the best of buildings was empty and still.
'Twas a weary while! Twelve winters' time
The lord of the Scyldings had suffered woe,
l!O Sore affliction and deep distress.
And the malice of Grendel, in mournful lays,
Was widely sung by the sons of men,
The hateful feud that he fought with
HrothgarYear after year of struggle and strife,
l!S An endless scourging, a scorning of peace
With any man of the Danish might.

12. murders. The poet here ironically refers to the Danes'
inability to force Grendel to pay wergild ("man-payment"),
or compensation, to the families of the warriors he has
murdered. In Anglo-Saxon and Germanic law, a .fixed price
in money was placed on the life of every individual in the
tribe, from the churl (the lowest-ranking freeman) to the
king. This money was paid by the killer's family to that of
the victim to avoid blood feud.

angry, in contrast to the silent zombies of Haiti.
A draugr is supernaturally strong and invulnerable (being already dead) and wili often have a
mother called a ketta, or "she-cat," who is even
more monstrous than he. Grendel, then, appears
to be a blend of the draugr figure and a devilish
monster from the world of Christian folklore.

11~ .Coming of Beowulf
• Then tales of the terrible deeds of Grendel
eached Hygelac's thane in his home with
• the Gears;
f living strong men he was the strongest,
earless and gallant and great of heart.
e gave command for a goodly vessel
;itted and furnished; he fain would sail
.. ver the swan-road to seek the king
o suffered so sorely for need of men.
d his bold retainers found little to blame
In his daring venture, dear though he was;
140 They viewed the omens, and urged him on.
Brave was the band he had gathered about
him,
Fourteen stalwarts seasoned and bold,
Seeking the shore where the ship lay waiting,
A sea-skilled mariner sighting the landmarks.
14s Came the hour of boarding; the boat was
riding
The waves of the harbor under the hill.
The eager mariners mounted the prow;
Billows were breaking, sea against sand.
In the ship's hold snugly they stowed their
trappings,
,so Gleaming armor and battle-gear;
Launched the vessel, the well-braced bark,
Seaward bound on a joyous journey.
Over breaking billows, with bellying sail
And foamy beak, like a flying bird
1ss The ship sped on, till the next day's sun
Showed sea-cliffs shining, towering hills
And stretching headlands. The sea was
crossed,
The voyage ended, the vessel moored.
And the Weder peopie13 waded ashore
"' With clatter of trappings and coats of mail;
Gave thanks to God that His grace had
granted
Sea-paths safe for their ocean-journey.
Then the Scylding coast guard watched
from the sea-cliff
Warriors bearing their shining shields,
165 Their gleaming war-gear, ashore from the
ship.
His mind was puzzled, he wondered much
What men they were. On his good horse
mounted,
Hrothgar's thane made haste to the beach,
Boldly brandished his mighty spear
170 With manful challenge: "What men are
you,
13. Weder people, Weder-Geaias, "Storm-Geats," an epithet for Beowulfs people.
Beowulf 13 
Carrying weapons and clad in steel,
Who thus come driving across the deep
On the ocean-lanes in your lofty ship?
Long have I served as the Scylding outpost,
175 Held watch and ward at the ocean's edge
Lest foreign foemen with hostile fleet
Should come to harry our Danish home,
And never more openly sailed to these shores
Men without password, or leave to land.
180 I have never laid eyes upon earl on earth
More stalwart and sturdy than one of your
'" troop,
A hero in armor; no hall-thane he
Tricked out with weapons, unless looks belie
him
And noble bearing. But now I must know
185 Your birth and breeding, nor may you come
In cunning stealth upon Danish soil.
You distant-dwellers, you far seafarers,
Hearken, and ponder words that are plain:
'Tis best you hasten to have me know
1,0 Who your kindred and whence you come."
The lord of the seamen gave swift reply,
The prince of the Weders unlocked his wordhoard:
"We are sprung of a strain of the Geatish
stock,
Hygelac's comrades and hearth-companions.
1,s My father was famous in many a folk-land,
A leader noble, Ecgtheowl4 his name! . . .
With loyal purpose we seek your lord,
The prince of your people, great Healfdene's
son . ...
You know if it's true, as we've heard it told,
200 That among the Scyldings some secret
scather,
Some stealthy demon in dead of night,
With grisly horror and fiendish hate
Is spreading unheard-of havoc and death.
Mayhap I can counsel the good, old king
205 What way he can master the merciless fiend,
If his coil of evil is ever to end
And feverish care grow cooler and fadeOr else ever after his doom shall be
Distress and sorrow while still there stands
14 The Anglo-Saxons
210 This best of halls on its lofty height."
Then from the saddle the coast guard
spoke,
The fearless sentry: "A seasoned warrior
Must know the difference between words and
deeds,
If his wits are with him. I take your word
215 That your band is loyal to the lord of the
Scyldings.
Now go your way with your weapons and
armor,
And I will guide you; I'll give command
That my good retainers may guard your
ship, ... "
Then the Geats marched on; behind at her

boat e:r 0
Safely rode on her swinging cable . ..- f ""
Boar-heads15 glittered on glistening hehnets
Above their cheek-guards, gleaming with
gold;
Bright and fire-hardened the boar held watch
225 Over the column of marching men.
Onward they hurried in eager haste
Till their eyes caught sight of the high-built
hall,
Splendid with gold, the seat of the king,
Most stately of structures under the sun;
230 Its light shone out over many a land.
The coast guard showed them the shining
hall,
The home of heroes; made plain the path;
Turned his horse; gave tongue to words:
"It is time to leave you! The mighty Lord
235 In His mercy shield you and hold you safe
In your bold adventure. I'll back to the sea
And hold my watch against hostile horde."

to choose from. Their language was rich in
synonyms: beorn, freca, and wiga all mean
"warrior," but with different connotations
derived from their original meanings as te;ms
f?r "bear," "wolf," and "fighter." In addiuon, the scops had developed a special vocabulary for poetry over the centuries, words and
phrases that fit neatly together. Alternate forms
were available to fit a particular context. For
example, if the scop began a line with a stressed
syllable starting with an h sound, he could say
"on the sea" by the phrase on hranrade ("on
the whale-road"); whereas if he began with an
s sound, he could use on seglriide ("on the sailroad").
Most of the compound words used in
Beowulf, like "shield-bearer," are easily
understood. But sometimes a more farfetched
riddling kind of descriptive comparison '
appears, for instance in the phrase "candle of
heaven" (line 1060), used to describe the sun.
This is a kenning, two or more words that
name something by a metaphor. There are
many of them in Anglo-Saxon poetry: "whaleroad" for ocean, "peace-weaver" for woman
"light of battle" for sword. '

Beowulf's Welcome at Hrothgar's Court
The street had paving of colored stone;
The path was plain to the marching men.
240 Bright were their byrnies, hard and handIinked;
In their shining armor the chain mail sang
As the troop in their war-gear tramped to the
hall.
The sea-weary sailors set down their shields,
Their wide, bright bucklers along the wall,
245 And sank to the bench. Their byrnies rang.
Their stout spears stood in a stack together
Shod with iron and shaped of ash.
'Twas a well-armed troop! Then a stately
warrior
Questioned the strangers about their kin:
zso "Whence come you bearing your burnished
shields,
Your steel-gray harness and visored helms,
Your heap of spears? I am Hrothgar's herald,
His servant-thane. I have never seen
strangers,
So great a number, of nobler mien.
2ss Not exiles, I ween, but high-minded heroes
In greatness of heart have you sought out
Hrothgar."
Then bold under helmet the hero made
answer,
Mighty of heart: "We are Hygelac's men,
His board-companions; Beowulf is my
name.
260 I will state my mission to Healfdene's son,
The noble leader, your lordly prince,
If he will grant approach to his gracious
presence."
And Wulfgar answered, the Wendel prince, 16
Renowned for merit in many a land,
265 For war-might and wisdom: "I will learn
J:he wish
Of the Scylding leader, the lord of the
Danes,
Our honored ruler and giver of rings,
Concerning your mission, and soon report
The answer our leader thinks good to give."
210 He swiftly strode to where Hrothgar sat
Old and gray with his earls17 about him;
16 The Anglo-Saxons
Crossed the floor and stood face to face
With the Danish king; he knew courtly
custom.
Wulfgar saluted his lord and friend:
m "Men from afar have fared to our land
Over ocean's margin-men of the Geats,
Their leader called Beowulf-seeking a boon,
The holding of parley, my prince, with thee.
0 gracious Hrothgar, refuse not the favor!
zso In their splendid war-gear they merit well
The esteem of earls; he's a stalwart leader
Who led t\us troop to the land of the Danes."
Hrothgar spoke, the lord of the Scyldings:
"Their leader I knew when he still was a
lad ....
2ss Seafaring men who have voyaged to
Geatland
With gifts of treasure as token of peace,
Say that his hand-grip has thirty men's
strength.
God, in His mercy, has sent him to save usSo springs my hope-from Grendel's
assaults.
290 For his gallant courage I'll load him with
gifts!
Make haste now, marshal the men to the hall,
And give them welcome to Danish ground."
Then to the door went the well-known
warrior,
Spoke from the threshold welcoming words:
295 "The Danish leader, my lord, declares
That he knows your kinship; right welcome
you come,
You stout sea-rovers, to Danish soil.
Enter now, in your shining armor
And vizored helmets, to Hrothgar's hall.
,oo But leave your shields and the shafts of
slaughter
To wait the issue and weighing of words."
Then the bold one rose with his band
around him,

Full often my warriors over their ale-cups
Boldly boasted, when drunk with beer,
365 They would bide in the beer-hall the coming
of battle,
The fury of Grendel, with flashing swords.
Then in the dawn, when the daylight
strengthened,
The hall stood reddened and reeking with
gore,
Bench-boards wet with the blood of battle;
370 And I had the fewer of faithful fighters,
Beloved retainers, whom Death had taken.
Sit now at the banquet, unbend your mood,
Speak of great deeds as your heart may spur
you!"
Then in the beer-hall were benches made
ready
375 For the Geatish heroes. Noble of heart,
Proud and stalwart, they sat them down
And a beer-thane served them; bore io his
hands
The patterned ale-cup, pouring the mead,
While the scop's sweet singing was heard in
the hall.
380 There was joy of heroes, a host at ease,
A welcome meeting of Weder and Dane.
18 The Anglo-Saxons
Unferth Taunts Beowulf
Then out spoke Unferth, Ecglafs son,19
Who sat at the feet of the Scylding lord,
Picking a quarrel-for Beowulf's quest,
385 His bold sea-voyaging, irked him sore;
He bore it ill that any man other
In all the earth should ever achieve
More fame under heaven than he himself:
"Are you the Beowulf that strove with
Breca20
390 In a swimming match in.the open sea,
Both of you wantonly tempting the waves,
Riskiog your lives on the lonely deep
For a silly boast? No man could dissuade you,
Nor friend nor foe, from the foolhardy
venture
395 Of ocean-swimming; with outstretched arms
You clasped the sea-stream, measured her
streets,
With plowing shoulders parted the waves.
The sea-flood boiled with its wintry surges,
Seven nights you toiled in the tossing sea;
400 His strength was the greater, his swimming
the stronger! . . .
Therefore, I ween, worse fate shall befall,
Stout as you are in the struggle of war,
In deeds of battle, if you dare to abide
Encounter with Grendel at coming of night."
405 Beowulf spoke, the son of Ecgtheow:
"My good friend Unferth, addled with beer·
Much have you made of the deeds of Breca!
I count it true that I had more courage,
More strength in swimming than any other
man.
,10 In our youth we boasted-we were both of
us boysWe would risk our lives in the raging sea.
And we made it good! We gripped in our
hands
Naked swords, as we swam in the waves,
19. Unferth, Ecglaf's (edj'lafs) son. Unferth's name can
be interpreted as "Peacebreaker." His role is a familiar one
in heroic poetry, that of the king's rude retainer whose
mockery provokes the hero to reveal himself. Something
very like the Unferth episode occurs in Book vm of the
Odyssey.

1:15 In the breaking seas he could not outstrip
me,
Nor would I leave him. For five nights long
Side by side we strove in the waters
Till racing combers wrenched us apart, .
Freezing squalls, and the falling night,·
420 And a bitter north wind's icy blast.
Rough were the waves; the wrath of the seafish
Was fiercely roused; but my firm-linked
byrny,
The gold-adorned corselet that covered my
breast,
Gave firm defense from the clutching foe.
425 Down to the bottom a savage sea-beast
Fiercely dragged me and held me fast
In a deadly grip; none the less it was granted
me
To pierce the monster with point of steel.
Death swept it away with the swing of my
sword.
430 The grisly sea-beasts again and again
Beset me sore; but I served them home
With my faithful blade as was well-befitting.
They failed of their pleasure to feast their fill
Crowding round my corpse on the oceanbottom!
435 Bloody with wounds, at the break of day,
They lay on the sea-bench slain with the
sword.
No more would they cumber the mariner's
course
On the ocean deep. From the east came the
sun,
Bright beacon of God, and the seas subsided;
440 I beheld the headlands, the windy walls.
Fate often delivers an undoomed earl
If his spirit be gallant! And so I was granted
To slay with the sword-edge nine of the
nicors.
I have never heard tell of more terrible strife
445 Under dome of heaven in darkness of night,
Nor of man harder pressed on the paths of
ocean.
But I freed my life from the grip of the foe
Though spent with the struggle. The billows
bore me,
The swirling currents and surging seas,
450 To the land of the Firms.21 And little I've
heard
Of any such valiant adventures from you!
Neither Breca nor you in the press of battle
Ever showed such daring with dripping
swordsThough I boast not of it! But you stained
your blade
,ss With blood of your brothers, your closest of
kin;
And for that you'll endure damnation in hell,
Sharp as you are! I say for a truth,
Son of Ecglaf, never had Grendel
Wrought such havoc and woe in the hall,
460 That horrid demon so harried your king,
If your heart were as brave as you'd have men
think!
But Grendel has found that he never need
fear
Revenge from your people, or valiant attack
From the Victor-Scyldings; he takes his toll,
465 Sparing none of the Danish stock.
He slays and slaughters and works his will
Fearing no hurt at the hands of the Danes!
But soon will I show him the stuff of the
Geats,
Their courage in battle and strength in the
strife;
470 Then let him who may go bold to the meadhall
When the next day dawns on the dwellings of
men,
And the sun in splendor shines warm from
the south."
Glad of heart was the giver of treasure,22
Hoary-headed and hardy in war;
475 The lordly leader had hope of help
As he listened to Beowulfs bold resolve.

J!:owulf Slays Grendel
In the hall as of old were brave words
spoken,
There was noise of revel; happy the host
Till the son of Healfdene would go to his
rest.
He knew that the monster would meet in the
hall
485 Relentless struggle when light of the sun
Was dusky with gloom of the gathering
night,
And shadow-shapes crept in the covering
dark,
Dim under heaven. The host arose.
Hrothgar graciously greeted his guest,
490 Gave rule of the wine-hall, and wished him
well,
\-<?'-• Praised the warrior in parting words:

'" JJ-'-' ~(J' 495 Be mindful of glory, show forth your

heart
Shall go unfulfilled if you live through the
fight."
Then Hrothgar withdrew with his host of
retainers, . . .
The Geatish hero put all his hope
soo In his fearless might and the mercy of God!
He stripped from his shoulders the byrny of
steel,
Doffed helmet from head; into hand of thane
Gave inlaid iron, the best of blades;
Bade him keep well the weapons of war.
sos Beowulf unered a gallant boast,
20 Tire Anglo-Saxons
The stalwart Geat, ere he sought his bed:
"I count myself nowise weaker in war
Or grapple of battle than Grendel himself.
Therefore I scorn to slay him with sword,
s10 Deal deadly wound, as I well might do!
Nothing he knows of a noble fighting,
Of thrusting and hewing and hacking of
shield,
Fierce as he is in the fury of war.
In the shades of darkness we'll spurn the
sword ,,,
s,s If he dares without weapon to do or to die.
And God in His wisdom shall glory assign,
The ruling Lord, as He deems it right."
Then the bold in battle bowed down to his
rest,
Cheek pressed pillow; the peerless thanes
s20 Were stretched in slumber around their lord.
525
Not one had hope of return to his home,
To the stronghold or land where he lived as
a boy.
For they knew how death had befallen the
Danes,
How many were slain as they slept in the
wine-hall. . . .
Then through the shades of enshrouding
night
The fiend came stealing; the archers slept
Whose duty was holding the horn-decked
hallThough one was watching-full well they
knew
No evil demon could drag them down
530 To shades under ground if God were not
willing.
But the hero watched awaiting the foe,
Abiding in anger the issue of war.
From the stretching moors, from the misty
hollows,
Grendel came creeping, accursed of God,
535 A murderous ravager minded to snare
Spoil of heroes in high-built hall.
Under clouded heavens he held his way
Till there rose before him the high-roofed
house,
Wine-hall of warriors gleaming with gold.

Nor was it the first of his fierce assaults
On the home of Hrothgar; but never before
··Had he found worse fate or hardier hallthanes!
• Storming the building he burst the portal,
Though fastened of iron, with fiendish
strength;
545 Forced open the entrance in savage fury
And rushed in rage o'er the shining floor.
A baleful glare from his eyes was gleaming
M~st like to a flame: He found in the hall
• Many a warrior sealed in slumber,
A host of kinsmen. His heart rejoiced;
liThe savage monster was minded to sever
Lives from bodies ere break of day,
To feast his fill of the flesh of men.
But he was not fated to glut his greed
• ss With more of mankind when the night was
ended!
The hardy kinsman of Hygelac waited
To see how the monster would make his
attack.
The demon delayed not, but quickly
clutched
A sleeping thane in his swift assault,
Tore him in pieces, bit through the bones,
Gulped the blood, and gobbled the flesh,
Greedily gorged on the lifeless corpse,
The hands and the feet. Then the fiend
stepped nearer,
Sprang on the Sea-Geat lying outstretched,
• 65 Clasping him close with his monstrous claw.
But Beowulf grappled and gripped him hard,
Struggled up on his elbow; the shepherd of
sins
Soon found that never before had he felt
In any man other in all the earth
570 A mightier hand-grip; his mood was
humbled,
His courage fled; but he found no escape!
He was fain to be gone; he would flee to the
darkness,
The fellowship of devils. Far different his
fate
°From that which befell him in former days!
_5 The hardy hero, Hygelac's kinsman,
Remembered the boast he had made at the
banquet;
He sprang to his feet, clutched Grendel fast,
Though fingers were cracking, the fiend
pulling free.
The earl pressed after; the monster was
minded
580 To win his freedom and flee to the fens.
He knew that his fingers were fast in the grip
Of a savage foe. Sorry the venture,
The raid that the ravager made on the hall.
There was din in Heorot. For all the
Danes,
585 The city-dwellers, the stalwart Scyldings,
That was a bitter spilling of beer!
The walls resounded, the fight was fierce,
Savage the strife as the warriors struggled.
The wonder was that the lofty wine-hall
590 Withstood the struggle, nor crashed to earth,
The house so fair; it was firmly fastened
Within and without with iron bands
Cunningly smithied; though men have said
That many a mead-bench gleaming with gold
595 Sprang from its sill as the warriors strove.
The Scylding wise men had never weened
That any ravage could wreck the building,
Firmly fashioned and finished with bone,
Or any cunning compass its fall,
600 Till the time when the swelter and surge of
fire
Should swallow it up in a swirl of flame. 23
.,,,,,_,_, Continuous tumult filled the hall;
A terror fell on the Danish folk
As they heard through the wall the horrible
wailing,
605 The groans of Grendel, the foe of God
Howling his hideous hymn of pain,
The hell-thane shrieking in sore defeat.
He was fast in the grip of the man who was
greatest
Of mortal men in the strength of his might,
610 Who would never rest while the wretch was
living,

in the poem to the later burning of Heorot.
Beowulf 21

i'
Counting his life-days a menace to man.
Many an earl of Beowulf brandished
His ancient iron to guard his lord,
To shelter safely the peerless prince.
615 They had no knowledge, those daring
thanes,
When they drew their weapons to hack and
hew,
To thrust to the heart, that the sharpest
sword,
The choicest iron in all the world,
Could work no harm to the hideous foe.
620 On every sword he had laid a spell,
On every blade; but a bitter death
Was to be his fate; far was the journey
The monster made to the home of fiends.
Then he who had wrought such wrong to
men,
625 With grim delight as he warred with God,
Soon found that his strength was feeble and
failing
In the crushing hold of Hygelac's thane.
Each loathed the other while life should last!
There Grendel suffered a grievous hurt,
630 A wound in the shoulder, gaping and wide;
Sinews snapped and bone-joints broke,
And Beowulf gained the glory of battle.
Grendel, fated, fled to the fens,
To his joyless dwelling, sick unto death.
635 He knew in his heart that his hours were
numbered,
His days at an end. For all the Danes
Their wish was fulfilled in the fall of Grendel.
The stranger from far, the stalwart and
strong,
Had purged of evil the hall of Hrothgar,
640 And cleansed of crime; the heart of the hero
Joyed in the deed his daring had done.
The lord of the Geats made good to the EastDanes
The boast he had uttered; he ended their ill,
And all the sorrow they suffered long
645 And needs must suffer-a foul offense.
The token was clear when the bold in battle
Laid down the shoulder and dripping clawGrendel's arm-in the gabled hall!
22 The Anglo-Saxons
The Joy of the Danes
When morning came, as they tell the tale,
650 Many a warrior hastened to hall,
Folk-leaders faring from far and near
Over wide-running ways, to gaze at the
wonder,
The trail of the demon. Nor seemed his
death
A matter of sorrow to any man
655 Who viewed the tracks of the vanquished
monster
As he slunk weary-hearted away from the
hall,
Doomed and defeated and marking his flight
With bloody prints to the nicors' pool.
The crimson currents bubbled and heaved
660 In eddying reaches reddened with gore;
The surges boiled with the fiery blood.
But the monster had sunk from the sight of
men.
In that fenny covert the cursed fiend
Not long thereafter laid.down his life,
665 His heathen spirit; and hell received him.
' Then all the comrades, the old and young,
The brave of heart, in a blithesome band
Came riding their horses home from the
mere.
Beowulfs prowess was praised in song;
670 And many men stated that south or north,
Over all the world, or between the seas,
Or under the heaven, no hero was greater.
Then spoke Hrothgar; hasting to hall
He stood at the steps, stared up at the roof
675 High and gold-gleaming; saw Grendel's
hand:
"Thanks be to God for this glorious sight!
I have suffered much evil, much outrage
from Grendel,
But the God of glory works wonder on
wonder.
I had no hope of a haven from sorrow ,
680 While this best of houses stood badged with

Hinges were riven; the roof alone
Remained unharmed when the horrid

With happy heart in the joy of feasting.
I never have heard of a mightier muster
Of proud retainers around their prince. .
Upon Beowulf, then, as a token of triumph,

APPLYING: Alliteration H,7
See Handbook of Literary Terms, p. 926
Alliteration is the repetition of sounds, usually consonants, at the beginning of words or
accented syllables:
Their stout spears stood in a stack together.
In Anglo-Saxon verse, alliteration is used rather
than rhyme to provide verbal music and to underscore rhythms.
1. Which words alliterate in lines 629-632? in
lines 659-662?
2. Read these two examples aloud, putting most
stress on the syllables that alliterate. How
many beats do you hear in each line?
COMPOSITION ~
W citing an Anglo-Saxon Letter
Imagine that you are a thane in Hrothgar's
court on a night when Grendel attacks. Write
a letter to a distant friend about what happens.
Begin by looking over the first part of Beowulf
for ideas or details. Brainstorm for other details
to make your narrative interesting. Plan your letter to run at least four paragraphs. In the first
you might describe the mead-hall during the evening meal. In the second explain how you feel as
you prepare for sleep. In the third narrate, from
your point of view, what happens when Grendel attacks. In your final paragraph, tell of your
reactions the next morning.
Explaining Beowulfs Motives
Explain to someone who has not read the
poem why Beowulf would risk a hazardous
ocean voyage to battle an unknown beast for a
distant king. In outlining your paper, plan for
at least three paragraphs, one each devoted to
Beowulfs ideas about honor, fame, and courage.
Scan his speeches in the first part of the poem to
find what he has to say about these values, and
use short quotations from the text to illustrate
your explanation. See "The Writing Process" in
the Composition Handbook.
ENRICHMENT
Researching a Reference
Look up the original story of Cain and Abel in
a Bible (Genesis 4: 1-16). Read it aloud to your
classmates, and then as a group discuss why the
Beowulf-poet calls Grendel "the seed of Cain" in
line 65. Be sure to consider where Grendel lives,
how he treats others, and how they deal with
him.
Beowulf 25 
I
~~---=------~ ..
At first glance, most modern readers of
English would think that a passage from Beowulf, like that below, is in a foreign language. A
closer look, however, suggests something a little different. In the first line is the word lond,
in the second wulf, in the third stream. A little
guesswork will suggest modern English equivalents for these words. The lines below are translated by Charles Kennedy on page 29 (lines
868-884). Four other translations of this same
passage appear on page 27. Notice how these
five translations differ.

hafelan [hydan]. Nis j,ret heoru stow!
In line 12 of the Anglo-Saxon, the poet uses
the kenning ha, -stapa to describe a male deer.
Both Spaeth and Kennedy choose a very literal, only slightly modernized version of the original words: "heather-stepper." Crossley-Holland
uses a slightly different form: "moor-stalker."
These odd phrases can puzzle some readers, so
to make it easier Alexander stretches the kenning out until it becomes a whole image: "The
hart that roams the heath . . . " Now its meaning may be clearer, but the translation doesn't
26 The Anglo.Saxons
sound very much like the original. Raffel avoids
the difficulty, and the poetic force, of the kenning altogether-in his version it becomes just
((A deer."
At the beginning of line 10 in the AngloSaxon is the phrase fyr on fl.ode, part of a description of the frightful lake where Grendel
and his mother live. The word on can be translated in various ways, and so, depending upon
whose translation you turn to, the fire is "beneath" (Spaeth), "in" (Kennedy and Alexander), or "on" (Crossley-Holland) the water.
Again Raffel ingeniously turns to a different
solution: "At night that lake/Burns like a
torch."
As the irregular line lengths suggest, all these
translators try not only to convey the ideas, but
also the quality of the poetry in Beowulf While
you may not be able to understand the third line
of the Anglo-Saxon here, it is easy enough to
notice the alliteration created by the repeated initial f sound, as well as the caesura, the gap in
the middle of the line that indicates a pause.
Now the question is, can the translators somehow imitate these sounds and rhythms in a form
the modern reader can understand? Alexander's
translation is very close to the order and the
literal meaning of the original words: "and
treacherous fen-paths: a torrent of water." There
are four t sounds here, but only two in stressed
syllables. There is alliteration, then, but it is
not very pronounced. Spaeth employs a different solution, intertwining the repetition of the m
and s sounds: "Ledges of mist, where mountain
torrents . . . "
Every good translation makes a statement of
some kind about the text it translates. For
example, when Raffel uses a plain word like
''deer" he emphasizes fact and action; when
Kennedy uses "hart" he suggests a more elevated and remote world. Spaeth's "To die on
the brink ere he brave the plunge" is certainly
different from Alexander's "will die there/
sooner than swim"; the one echoes an older tradition of poetic speech, while the other sounds
almost like slang.

The Troll-Wife Avenges Grendel
790 • • • At the fairest of feasts
Men drank of the wine-cup, knowing not
Fate,
Nor the fearful doom that befell the earls
When darkness gathered, and gracious
Hrothgar
Sought his dwelling and sank to rest.
795 A host of heroes guarded the hall
As they oft had done in the days of old.
They stripped the benches and spread the
floor
With beds. and bolsters. But one of the beerthanes
Bowed to his hall-rest doomed to death.
800 They set at their heads their shining shields,
Their battle-bucklers; and there on the
bench
Above each hero his towering helmet,
His spear and corselet hung close at hand.
It was ever their wont to be ready for war
805 At home or in field, as it ever befell
That their lord had need. 'Twas a noble race!
Then they sank to slumber. But one paid
dear
For his evening rest, as had often happened
When Grendel haunted the lordly hall
810 And wrought such ruin, till his end was
come,
Death for his sins; it was easily seen,
Though the monster was slain, an avenger
survived
Prolonging the feud, though the fiend had
perished.
The mother of Grendel, a monstrous hag,
815 Brooded over her misery, doomed to dwell
In evil waters and icy streams. . . .
But rabid and raging his mother resolved
On a dreadful revenge for the death of her
son!
28 The Anglo-Saxons
She stole to the hall where the Danes were
sleeping,
820 And horror fell on the host of earls
When the dam I of Grendel burst in the door.
But the terror was less as the war-craft is
weaker,
A woman's strength, than the might of a
man ...
As soon as discovered, the hag was in haste
825 To fly to the open, to flee for her life.
One of the warriors she swiftly seized,
Clutched him fast and made off to the fens.
He was of heroes the dearest to Hrothgar,
The best of comrades between two seas;
830 The warrior brave, the stouthearted
spearman,
"-she slew in his sleep. Nor was Beowulf there;
But after the banquet another abode
Had been assigned to the glorious Geat.
There was tumnlt in Heorot. She tore from
its place
835 The bloodstained claw. Care was renewed!
It was no good bargain when both in turn
Must pay the price with the lives of friends!
Then the white-haired warrior, the aged
king,
Was numb with sorrow, knowing his thane
''° No longer was living, his dearest man dead.
Beowulf, the brave, was speedily summoned.
The hero came tramping into the hall
With his chosen band-the boards
resoundedGreeted the leader, the IngwineZ lord,
845 And asked if the night had been peacefnl and
pleasant.

He was my comrade, closest of counsellors,
850 My shoulder-companion as side by side
We fought for our lives in the welter of war,
In the shock of battle when boar-helms
crashed.
As an earl should be, a prince without peer,
Such was ffischere, ·slain in the hall
855 By the wandering demon! I know not
whither
She fled to shelter, proud of her spoil,
Gorged to the full. She avenged the
feud. . . . ,
Oft in the hall I have heard my people,
Comrades and counsellors, telling a tale
''° Of evil spirits their eyes have sighted,
Two mighty marauders wl).a haunt the
moors.
One shape, as clearly as men could see,
Seemed woman's likeness, and one seemed
man,
An outcast wretch of another world,
865 And huger far than a human form.
Grendel my countrymen called him, not
knowing
What monster-brood spawned him, what
sire begot.
Wild and lonely the land they live in,
Windswept ridges and wolf-retreats,
870 Dread tracts of fen where the falling torrent
Downward dips into gloom and shadow
Under the dusk of the darkening cliff.
Not far in miles lies the lonely mere
Where trees firm-rooted and hung with frost
875 Overshroud the wave with shadowing
gloom.
And there a porte_nt appears each night,
A flame in the water; no man so wise
Who knows the bound of its bottomless
depth.
The heather-stepper, the horned stag,
880 The antlered hart hard driven by hounds,
Invading that forest in flight from afar
Will turn at bay and die on the brink
Ere ever he'll plunge in that haunted pool.
'Tis an eerie spot! Its tossing spray
885 Mounts dark to heaven when high winds stir
The driving storm, and the ·sky is murky,
And with foul weather the heavens weep.
On your arm only rests all our hope!
Not yet have you tempted those terrible
reaches,
890 The region that shelters that sinful wight.
Go if you dare! I will give requital
With ancient treasure and twisted gold,
As I formerly gave in guerdon of battle,
If out of that combat you come alive."
~ Beowulf spoke, the son of Ecgtheow:
"Sorrow not, brave one! Better for man
To avenge a friend than much to mourn.
NI men must die; let him who may
Win glory ere death. That guerdon is best
900 For the noble man when hisrname survives
him.
Then let us rise up, 0 ward of the realm,
And haste us forth to behold the track
Of Grendel's dam. And I give you pledge
She shall not in safety escape to cover,
905 To earthy cavern, or forest fastness,
Or gulf of ocean, go where she may.
This day with patience endure the burden
Of every woe, as I know you will."
Up sprang the ancient, gave thanks to God .
,10 For the heartening words the hero had
spoken.
Beowulf Slays the Troll-Wife
Quickly a horse was bridled for Hrothgar,
A mettlesome charger with braided l}lane;
In royal splendor the king rode forth
Mid the trampling tread of a troop of
shieldmen.

fared

Through murky moorland making her way
With the lifeless body, the best of thanes
Who of old with Hrothgar had guarded the
hall.
no By a narrow path the king pressed on.
Through rocky upland and rugged ravine,
A lonely journey, past looming headlands,
The lair of monster and lurking troll.
Tried retainers, a trusty few,
925 Advanced with Hrothgar to view the ground.
Sudd~n they came on a dismal covert
Of trees that hung over hoary stone,
Over churning water and bloodstained wave.
Then for .the Danes was the woe the deeper,
930 The sorrow sharper for Scylding earls,
When they first caught sight,. on the rocky
sea-cliff,
Of slaughtered ll',schere's severed head.
The water boiled in a bloody swirling
With seething gore as the spearmen gazed.
935 The trumpet sounded a martial strain;
The shield-troop halted. Their eyes beheld
The swimming forms of strange seadragons,
Dim serpent shapes in the watery depths,
Sea-beasts sunning on headland slopes;
940 Snakelike monsters that oft at sunrise
On evil errands scour the sea.
Startled by tumult and trumpet's blare,
Enraged and savage, they swam away;
But one the lord of the Geats brought low,
945 Stripped of his sea-strength, despoiled of
life,
As the bitter bow-bolt pierced his heart.
His watery-speed grew slower, and ceased,
And he floated, caught in the clutch of death.
Then they hauled him in with sharp-hooked
boar-spears,
950 By sheer strength grappled and dragged him
ashore,
A wondrous wave-beast; and all the array
Gathered to gaze at the grisly guest.
Beowulf donned his armor for battle,
Heeded not danger; the hand-braided byrny,
955 Broad of shoulder and richly bedecked,
Must stand the ordeal of the watery depths.
30 The Anglo-Saxons
Well could that corselet defend the frame
Lest hostile thrust should pierce to the heart.
Or blows of battle beat down the life.
960 A gleaming helmet guarded his head
As he planned his plunge to the depths of
the pool
Through the heaving waters-a helm adorned
With lavish inlay and lordly chains,
Ancient work of the weapon-smith
965 Skillfully fashioned, beset with the boar,
That no blade of battle might bite it through.
Not the least or the worst of his warequipment
Was the sword the herald of Hrothgar loaned
In his hour of need-Hrunting' its name970 An ancient heirloom, trusty and tried;
Its blade was iron, with etched design,
Tempered in blood of many a battle.
Never in fight had it failed the hand
That drew it daring the perils of war,
975 The rush of the foe. Not the first time then
That its edge must venture on valiant
deeds ....
Beowulf spoke, the son of Ecgtheow:
"O gracious ruler, gold-giver to men,
As I now set forth to attempt this feat,
,so Great son of Healfdene, hold well in mind
The solemn pledge we plighted of old,_,,
That if doing your se.rvice I meet my death
You will mark my fall with a father's love.
Protect my kinsmen, my trusty comrades,
985 If battle take me. And all the treasure
You have heaped on me besf-pw upon
Hygelac. . . . " \
After these words the prince of the Weders
Awaited no answer, but turned to the task,
Straightway plunged in the swirling pool.
990 Nigh unto a day he endured the depths
Ere he first had view of the vast sea-bottom.
Soon she found, who had haunted the flood,

Greedy and grim, that a man was groping

995 In daring search through the sea-troll's

$wift she grappled and grasped the warrior
With horrid grip, but could work no harm,
No hurt to his body; the ring-Jocked byrny
Cloaked his life from her clutching claw;
1000 Nor could she tear through the tempered
mail
With her savage fingers. The she-wolf bore
The ring-prince down through the watery
depths
To her den at the bottom; nor could Beowulf
draw
His blade for battle, though brave his mood.
100s Many a sea-beast, strange sea-monsters,
Tasked him hard with their menacing tusks,
Broke his byrny and smote him sore.
Then he found himself in a fearsome hall
Where water came not to work him hurt,
1010 But the flood was stayed by the sheltering "'
roof.
There in the glow of firelight g]eanling
The hero had view of the huge sea-troll.
He swung his war-sword with all his
strength,
Withheld not the blow, and the savage blade
101s Sang on her head its hymn of hate.
But the bold one found that the battle-flasher
Would bite no longer, nor harm her life.
The sword-edge failed at his sorest need.
Often of old with ease it had suffered
1020 The clash of battle, cleaving the helm,
The fated warrior's woven mail.
That time was first for the treasured blade
That its glory failed in the press of the fray.
But fixed of purpose and firm of mood
1021 Hygelac's earl was mindful of honor;
In wrath, undaunted, he dashed to earth
The jewelled sword with its scrolled design,
The blade of steel; staked all on strength,
On the might of his hand, as a man must do
1oio Who thinks to win in the welter of battle
Enduring glory; he fears not death.
The Geat-prince joyed in the straining
struggle,
Stalwart-hearted and stirred to wrath,
Gripped the shoulder of Grendel's dam
10ss And headlong hurled the hag to the ground.
But she quickly clutched him and drew him
close,
Countered the onset with savage claw.
The warrior staggered, for all his strength;
Dismayed and shaken and borne to earth.
w,6 She knelt upon him and drew her dagger,
With broad bright blade, to avenge her son,
Her only issue. But the corselet's steel
Shielded his breast and sheltered his life
Withstanding entrance of point and
edge ....
'°" Swift the hero sprang to his feet;
Saw mid the war-gear a stately sword,
An ancient war-brand of biting edge,
Choicest of weapons worthy and strong,
The work of giants, a warrior's joy,
10so So heavy no hand but his own could hold it,
Bear to battle or wield in war.
Then the Scylding warrior, savage and grim,
Seized the ring-hilt and swung the sword,
Struck with fury, despairing of life,
10ss Thrust at the throat, broke through the bonerings;
The stout blade stabbed through her fated
flesh.
She sank in death; the sword was bloody;
The hero joyed in the work of his hand.
The gleaming radiance shimmered and
shone
w,o As the candle of heaven shines clear from
the sky.
Wrathful and resolute Hygelac's thane
Surveyed the span of the spacious hall;
Grimly gripping the hilted sword
With upraised weapon he turned to the
wall. ...
l06S And there before him bereft of life
• He saw the broken body of Grendel
Stilled in battle, and stretched in death,
As the struggle in Heorot smote him down.
The corpse sprang wide as he struck the
blow,
l070 The hard sword-stroke ·that severed the
head.
Beowulf 31 
I '
Then the tried retainers, who there with
Hrothgar
Watched the face of the foaming pool,
Saw that the churning reaches were
reddened,
The eddying surges stained with blood.
101s And the gray, old spearmen spoke of the
hero,
Having no hope he would ever return
Crowned with triumph,.and cheered with
spoil.
Many were sure that the savage sea-wolf
Had slain their leader. At last came noon.
10,0 The stalwart Scyldings forsook the
headland;
TJ:\eir proud gold-giver departed home.
But the Geats sat grieving and sick in spirit,
Stared at the water with longing eyes,
Having no hope they would ever behold
1oss Their gracious leader and lord again.
Then the great sword, eaten with blood of
battle,
Began to soften and waste away
In iron icicles, wonder of wonders,
Melting away most like to ice
10,0 When the Father looses the fetters of frost,
Slackens the bondage that binds the wave,
Strong in power of times and seasons;
He is true God! Of the goodly treasures
From the sea-cave Beowulf took but two,
10,s The monster's head and the precious hilt
Blazing with gems; but the blade had
melted,
The sword dissolved, in the deadly heat,
The venomous blood of the fallen fiend ..
Beowulf Returns to Heorot
With sturdy strokes the lord of the seamen
noo To land came swimming, rejoiced in his
spoil,
Had joy of the burden he brought from the
depths.
And his mighty thanes came forward to meet
him,
Gave thanks to God they were granted to see
Their well-loved leader both sound and safe.
3 2 The Anglo-Saxons
nos From the stalwart hero his helmet and byrny
Were quickly loosened; the lake.lay still,
Its motionless reaches reddened with
blood ....
From the sea-cliffs brim the warriors bore
The head of Grendel, with heavy toil;
n10 Four of the stoutest, with all their strength,
Could hardly carry on swaying spear
Grendel's head to the gold-decked hall.
Swift they strode, the daring and dauntless,
Fourteen Geats, to the Hall of the Hart;
ms And proud in the midst of his marching men
Their leader measured the path to the meadhall.
- The hero entered, the hardy in battle,
The great in glory, to greet the king;
And Grendel's head by the hair was carried
1120 Across the floor where the feasters drankA terrible sight for lord and for ladyA gruesome vision whereon men gazed!
Beowulf spoke, the son of Ecgtheow:
"O son of Healfdene, lord of the Scyldings!
112s This sea-spoil wondrous, whereon you stare,

1150 The work of giants, the wonder of gold ..
Hrothgar spoke, beholding the hilt,
The lUJcient relic whereon was etched
An olden record of struggle and strife,
The flood5 that ravaged the giant race,
• 155 The rushing deluge of ruin and death.
• That evil kindred were alien to God,
But the Ruler avenged with the wrath of the
deep! ...
Then out spoke Hrothgar, Healfdene's son,
And all the retainers were silent and still:
1iiio "Well may he say, whose judgment is just,
' • Recalling to memory inen of the past,
That this earl was born of a better stock!
Your fame, friend Beowulf, is blazoned
abroad

'Tis a wondrous marvel how mighty God
mo In gracious spirit bestows on men
The gift of wisdom, and goodly lands,
And princely power! He rules over all!
He suffers a man of lordly line
To set his heart on his own desires,
1115 Awards him fullness of worldly joy,
A fair homeland, and the sway of cities,
The wide dominion of many a realm,
An ample kingdom, till, cursed with folly,
The thoughts of his heart take no heed of his
end.
1180 He lives in luxury, knowing not want,
Knowing no shadow of sickness or age;
No haunting sorrow darkens his spirit,
No hatred or discord deepens to war;
The world is sweet, to his every desire,
11s5 And evil assails not-until in his heart
Pride overpowering gathers and grows!
The warder slumbers, the guard of his spirit;
Too sound is that sleep, too sluggish the
weight
Of worldly affairs, too pressing the Foe,
11,0 The Archer who looses the arrows of sin.
Then is his heart pierced, under his helm,
His soul in his bosom, with bitter dart.
He bas no defense for the fierce assaults
Of the loathsome Fiend. What he long has
cherished
1195 Seems all too little! In anger and greed
He gives no guerdon of plated rings.
Since God has granted him glory and w~alth
He forgets the future, unmindful of Fate.
But it comes to pass in the day appointed
1200 His feeble body withers and fails;
Death descends, and another seizes
His hoarded riches and rashly spends
The princely \reasure, imprudent of heart.
Beloved BeoWulf, best of warriors, ~7· Avoid such evil and seek the good,

Now for. a time you shall feel the fullness
• 'And know the glory of strength, but soon
Sickness or sword shall strip you of might,
1210 Or clutch of fire, or clasp of flood,
Or flight of arrow, or bite of blade,
Or relentless age; or the light of the eye
Shall darken and dim, and death on a
sudden,
0 lordly ruler, shall lay you low.
121s A hundred half-years I've been head of the
Ring-Danes,
Defending the folk against many a tribe
With spear-point and sword in the surges of
battle
Till not one was hostile 'neath heaven's
expanse.
But a loathsome change swept over the land,

mentioned in Genesis 6:4.
Beowulf 33 
That evil invader, that ancient foe!
Great sorrow of soul from his malice I
suffered;
But thanks be to God who has spared me to
see
His bloody head at the battle's end!
1225 Join now in the banquet; have joy of the
feast,

bring
Exchange of treasure in ample store." •
Happy of heart the Geat leader hastened,
Took seat at the board as the good king bade.
1230 Once more, as of old, brave heroes made
merry
And tumult of revelry rose in the hall.
Then dark over men the night shadows
deepened;
The host all arose, for Hrothgar was minded,
The gray, old Scylding, to go to his rest.
1235 On Beowulf too, after labor of battle,
Came limitless longing and craving for sleep.
A hall-thane graciously guided the hero,
Weary and worn, to the place prepared,
Serving his wishes and every want
1240 As befitted a mariner come from afar.
The stout-hearted warrior sank to his rest;
The lofty building, splendid and spacious,
Towered above him. His sleep was sound
Till the black-coated raven, blithesome of
spirit,
1245 Hailed the coming of Heaven's bliss.
The Parting of Beowulf and Hrothgar
Then over the shadows uprose the sun.
The Geats were in haste, and eager of heart
To depart to their people. Beowulflonged
To embark in his boat, to set sail for his
home.
mo The hero tendered the good sword Hrunting
To the son of Ecglaf, bidding him bear
The lovely blade; gave thanks for the loan,
Called it a faithful friend in the fray,
Bitter in battle. The greathearted hero
1255 Spoke no word in blame of the blade!
Arrayed in war-gear, and ready for sea,
34 The Anglo-Saxons
The warriors bestirred them; and, dear to the
Danes,
Beowulf sought the high seat of the king.
The gallant in war gave greeting to Hrothgar;
1260 Beowulf spoke, the son of Ecgtheow:
"It is time at last to tell of our longing!
Our homes are far, and our hearts are fain
To seek again Hygelac over the sea.
You have welcomed us royally, harbored us
well
1265 As a man could wish; if I ever can win
Your affection more fully, 0 leader of
heroes,
Swift shall you find me to serve you again!"
Hrothgar addressed him, uttered his
answer:
"Truly, these words has the Lord of wisdom
1270 Set in your heart, for I never have hearkened
To speech so sage from a man so young.
You have strength, and prudence, and
wisdom of word! . . .
The Sea-Geats could have no happier choice
If you would be willing to rule the realm,
1275 As king to hold guard o'er the hoard and the
heroes.
The longer I know you, the better I like you,
Beloved Beowulf! You have brought it to
pass
That between our peoples a lasting peace
Shall bind the Geats to the Danish-born;
1280 And strife shall vanish, and war shall cease,
And former feuds, while I rule this realm."
Then the son of Healfdene, shelter of earls,
Bestowed twelve gifts on the hero in hall,
Bade him in safety with bounty of treasure
1285 Seek his dear people, and soon return.
The peerless leader, the Scylding lord,
Kissed the good thane and clasped to his
bosom
While tears welled fast from the old man's
eyes.
Both chances he weighed in his wise, old
heart,
1290 But greatly doubted if ever again
They should meet at council or drinking of

COMPOSITION -49
De.scribing a Monster's Lair
Lines 868-887 describe where Grendel's
mother lives. Write a description of an appropriate lair for a modern monster. To begin, review
the scene in Beowulf, noting the important
details. Then, using your imagination, translate
those details into modern terms. For example,
the hidden cave might become a sewer pipe or
an underground garage. Organize your description in the form of a journey, the first paragraph
picturing the surrounding countryside, the second the means of entering the hiding place, the
Beowulf 35 
third what the lair itself looks like, and the last
the kinds of things one finds there. Assume that
your classmates will be your audience and write
to capture their interest.
Writing a Persuasive Essay
In several speeches Beowulf talks about his
achievements. Write an essay of at least five
paragraphs directed to your classmates in which
you take a side on the question: Is Beowulf
a braggart? First review Beowulfs speeches,
listing statements that seem to you excessively
boastful, or, by contrast, appropriate for the
situation. Next outline your argument. Your
first paragraph should define brag; you may use
a dictionary definition or write your own. In the
second, third, and fourth paragraphs, examine
your text examples to determine whether they
are or are not brags. Finally, in a concluding
paragraph, sum up your ideas about the way
this hero talks. See "Writing to Persuade an
Audieuce" in the Writer's Handbook.

Beowulf Returns to Geatland
Then down to the sea came the band of the
brave,
1305 The host of young heroes in harness of war,
In their woven mail; and the coast-warden
viewed
The heroes' return, as he heeded their
coming!
No uncivil greeting he gave from the sea-cliff
As they strode to ship in their glistening
steel;
1310 But rode toward them and called their return
A welcome sight for their Weder kin.
There on the sand the ring-stemmed ship,
The broad-bosomed bark, was loaded with
war-gear,
With horses and treasure; the mast towered
high
!3!5 Over the riches of Hrothgar's hoard.
A battle-sword Beowulf gave to the boatwarden
Hilted with gold; and thereafter in hall
He had the more honor because of the
heirloom,
The shining treasure. The ship was
launched.
1320 Cleaving the combers of open sea
36 The Anglo-Saxons
They dropped the shoreline of Denmark
astern.
A stretching sea-cloth, a bellying sail,
Was bent on the mast; there was groaning of
timbers;
A gale was blowing; the boat drove on.
1325 The foamy-necked plunger plowed through
the billows,
The ring-stemmed ship through the
breaking seas,
Till at last they sighted the sea-cliffs of
Geatland,
The well-known headlands; and, whipped
by the wind,
The boat drove shoreward and beached on
the sand ....
1330 Then the hero strode with his stalwart
band
Across the stretches of sandy beach,
The wide sea-shingle. The world-candle
shone,
The hot sun hasting on high from the south.
Marching together they made their way
1335 To where in his stronghold the stout young
king, ...
Dispensed his treasure. Soon Hygelac heard

That his shoulder-companion had come to
his court
Sound and safe from the strife of battle.
The hall was prepared, as the prince gave
bidding,
Places made ready for much travelled men.
And he who came safe from the surges of
battle
Sat by the side of the king himself, . . .
In friendly fashion in high-built hall
Hygelac questioned his comrade and thane;
For an eager longing burned in his breast
To hear from the Sea-Geats the tale of their
travels ....
Beowulf now tells the king of his battles with
Grendel and Grendel's mother, and of the rewards his victory has won. He concludes:
"These riches I bring you ruler of heroes,
And warmly tender with right good will.
1350 Save for you, king Hygelac, few are my
kinsm~n,
Few are the favors but come from you."
Then he bade men bring the boar-crested
headpiece,
The towering helmet, and steel-gray sark,I
The splendid war-sword, and spoke this
word:
1355 "The good king Hrothgar gave me this gift,
This battle-armor, and first to you
Bade tell the tale of his friendly favor.
Well may you wear it! Have joy of it
all.". . .
Then the battle-bold king, the bulwark
of heroes,
1360 Bade bring a battle-sword banded with gold,
The heirloom of Hrethel; 2 no sharper steel,
No lovelier treasure, belonged to the Geats.
He laid the war-blade on Beowulfs lap,
Gave him a hall and a stately seat
1365 And hides3 seven thousand. Inherited lands
Both held by birth-fee, home and estate.
But one held rule o'er the spacious realm,
And higher therein his order and rank. -

The Fire-Dragon and the Treasure
It later befell in the years that followed
1370 After Hygelac sank in the surges of war, .
That the kingdom came into Beowulfs
hand.
For fifty winters he governed it well,
Aged and wise with the wisdom "of years,
Till a fire-drake4 flying in darkness of night
1375 Began to ravage and work his will.
On the upland heath he guarded a hoard,
A stone barrow lofty. Under it lay r
A path concealed from the sight of men. '
There a thief broke in on the heathen
treasure,
t38o Laid hand on a flagon all fretted with gold,
As the dragon discovered, though cozened in
sleep
By the pilferer's cunning. The people soon
found
1. sark, shirt (here, of mail).
2. Hrethel (hreth'::il), king of the Gears, father of Hygelac, grandfather of Beowulf.
3. hides. The hide (roughly, as much land as could be
worked by one plow in a single year) varied from 40 to
120 acres. Seven thousand hides is a huge piece of land.
4. fire-drake, a fire-breathing dragon.

That the mood of the dragon was roused to
wrath! ...
For three hundred winters this waster of
peoples •
1385 Held the huge treasure-hall under the earth
Till the robber aroused him to anger and
rage,
Stole the rich beaker and bore to his master,
Imploring his lord for a compact of peace.
So the hoard was robbed and its riches
plundered;
1390 To the wretch was granted the boon that he
begged;
And his liege-lord first had view of the
treasure,
The ancient work of the men of old.
Then the worm awakened and war was
kindled,
The rush of the monster along the rock,
139s When the fierce one found the tracks of the
foe; ...
Swiftly the fire-drake sought through the
plain
The man who wrought him this wrong in his
sleep. • •.
Inflamed and savage he circled the mound,
But the waste was deserted-no man was in
sight.
1400 The worm's mood was kindled to battle and
war;
Time and again he returned to the barrow
Seeking the treasure-cup. Soon he was sure
That a man had plundered the precious gold.
Enraged and restless the hoard-warden
waited
1405 The gloom of evening. The guard of the
mound
Was swollen with anger; the fierce one
resolved
To requite with fire the theft of the cup.
Then the day was sped as the worm desired;
Lurking no longer within his wall
1410 He sallied forth surrounded with fire,
Encircled with flame. For the folk of the land
The beginning was dread as the ending was
grievous
3 8 The Anglo-Saxons
That came so quickly upon their lord.
Then the baleful stranger belched fire and
flame,
1415 Burned the bright dwellings--the glow of the
blaze
Filled hearts with horror. The hostile flier
Was minded to leave there nothing alive.
From near and from far the war of the
dragon,
. The might of the monster, was widely
revealed
1420 So that all could see how the ravaging scather
Hated and humbled the Geatish folk.
Then he hastened back ere the break of dawn
To his secret den and the spoil of gold.
He had compassed the land with a flame of
fire,
1425 A blaze of burning; he trusted the wall,
The sheltering mound, and the strength of
his mightBut his trust betrayed him! The terrible news
Was brought to Beowulf, told for a truth,
That his home was consumed in the surges
of fire ....
1430 Dark thoughts stirred in his surging bosom,
Welled in his breast, as was not his wont.
The flame of the dragon had levelled the
fortress,
The people's stronghold washed by the
wave.
But the king of warriors, prince of the
Weders,
1435 Exacted an ample revenge for it all.
The lord of warriors and leader of earls
Bade work him of iron a wondrous shield,
Knowing full well that wood could not serve
him
Nor linden5 defend him against the flame.
1440 The stalwart hero was doomed to suffer
The destined end of his days on earth;
Likewise the worm, though for many a
winter
He had held his watch o'er the wealth of the
hoard.

For all the rich gifts that Hygelac gave me

So shall I bear me while life-days last,

Beowulf and Wiglaf Slay the Dragon
The king for the last time greeted his
comrades,
Bold helmet-bearers and faithful friends:
"I would bear no sword nor weapon to battle
With the evil worm, if I knew how else
1400 I could close with the fiend, as I grappled
with Grendel.
From the worm I look for a welling of fire,
A belching of venom, and therefore I bear
Shield and byrny. Not one foot's space
Will I flee from the monster, the ward of the
mound.
1495 It shall fare with us both in the fight at the
wall
As Fate shall allot, the lord of mankind.
Though bold in spirit, I make no boast
As I go to fight with the flying serpent.
Clad in your corselets and trappings of war,
1500 By the side of the barrow abide you to see
Which of us twain may best after battle
Survive his wounds. Not yours the
adventure,
Nor the mission of any, save mine alone,
To measure his strength with the monstrous
dragon
1505 And play the part of a valiant earl.
By deeds of daring I'll gain the gold
Or death in battle shall break your lord."
Then the stalwart rose with his shield upon
him,
Bold under helmet, bearing his sark
1510 Under the stone-cliff; he trusted the strength
Of his single might. Not so does a coward!
He who survived through many a struggle,
40 The Anglo-Saxons
Many a combat and crashing of troops,
Saw where a stone-arch stood by the wall
1515 And a gushing stream broke out from the
barrow.
Hot with fire was the flow of its surge,
Nor could any abide near the hoard
unburned,
Nor endure its depths, for the flame of the
dragon.
Then the lord of the Geats in the grip of his
fury
1520 Gave shout of defiance; the strong-heart
stormed.
His voice rang out with the rage of battle,
Resounding under the hoary stone.
Hate was aroused; the hoard-warden knew
'Twas the voice of a man. No more was there
time
1525 To sue for peace; the breath of the serpent,
A blast of venom, burst from the rock.
The ground resounded; the lord of the Geats
Under the barrow swung up his shield
To face the dragon; the coiling foe
1530 Was gathered to strike in the deadly strife.
The stalwart hero had drawn his sword,
His ancient heirloom of tempered edge;
In the heart of each was fear of the other!
The shelter of kinsmen stood stout of heart
1535 Under towering shield as the great worm
coiled;
Clad in his war-gear he waited the rush.
In twisting folds the flame-breathing dragon
Sped to its fate. The shield of the prince
For a lesser while guarded his life and his
body
1540 Than heart had hoped. For the first time
then
It was not his portion to prosper in war;
Fate did not grant him glory in battle!
Then lifted his arm the lord of the Geats
And smote the worm with his ancient sword
1545 But the brown edge failed as it fell on bone,
And cut less deep than the king had need
In his sore distress. Savage in mood

Renewed their grapple. The guard of the

Grew fiercer in fury. His venomous breath

, The folk-leader suffered a sore distress.
1555 No succoring band of shoulder-companions,
No sons of warriors aided him then
By valor in battle. They fled to the forest
To save their lives; but a sorrowful spirit
Welled in the breast of one of the band.
!560 The call of kinship can never be stilled
In the heart of a man who is trusty and
trne.
His name was Wiglaf, Weohstan's son,
A prince of the Scylfings, a peerless thane,
£Ifhere's kinsman;6 he saw his king
l565 Under his helmet smitten with heat.
He thought of the gifts which his lord had
given,
The wealth and the land of the
Wregmunding line
And all the folk-rights his father had owned;
Nor could he hold back, but snatched up his
buckler,
1570 His linden shield and his ancient sword. . . .
Wiglaf spoke in sorrow of soul,
With bitter reproach rebuking his comrades:
"I remember the time, as we drank in the
mead-hall,
When we swore to our lord who bestowed
these rings
1575 That we would repay for the war-gear and
. armor,
The hard swords and helmets, if need like
this
Should ever befall him. He chose us out
From all the host for this high adventure.
Now is the day that our lord has need
1580 Of the strength and courage of stalwart men.
Let us haste to succor his sore distress
In the horrible heat and the merciless flame.
God knows I had rather the fire should enfold
My body and limbs with my gold-friend and
lord. , ..
1585 One helmet and sword, one byrny and
shield,
Shall serve for us both in the storm of strife."
Then Wiglaf dashed through the deadly reek
In his battle-helmet to help his lord.
Brief were his words: "Beloved Beowulf,
,s,o Summon your strength, remember the vow
You made of old in the years of youth
Not to allow your glory to lessen
As long as you lived. With resolute heart,
And dauntless daring, defend your life
1s,s With all your force. I fight at your side!"
Once again the worm, when the words
were spoken,
The hideous foe in a horror of flame,
Rushed in rage at the hated men.
Wiglaf's buckler was burned to the boss
1600 In the billows of fire; his byrny of mail
Gave the young hero no help or defense.
But he stoutly pressed on under shield of his
kinsman
When his own was consumed in the
scorching flame.
Then the king once more was mindful of
glory,
1,05 Swung his great sword-blade with all his
might
And drove it home on the dragon's head.
But Nregling7 broke, it failed in the battle,
The blade of Beowulf, ancient and
gray ....
A third time then the terrible scather,

feud,
Rushed on the king when the opening
offered,
Fierce and flaming; fastened its fangs

(shil'fings), the ruling family among the Swedes, and
a member of the Wregmunding (wag'mim cling) family
(see lines 1567-1568), the Geatish clan to which Beowulf
belonged. Weohstan may have been a Swedish exile in
Geatland (as the result of a blood feud) who had settled on
Wregmund.ing lands. £lfhere (alf'her rn) is not otherwise
known.

related to 114g/, "nail."

In Beowulfs throat; he was bloodied with
gore;
His lifeblood streamed from the welling
wound.
1615 As they tell the tale, in the king's sore need
His shoulder-companion showed forth his
valor,
His craft and courage, and native strength.
To the head of the dragon he paid no heed,
Though his hand was burned as he helped
his king.

The Treasure of Sutton Hoo
In the late spring of 1939, archaeologists
began excavating a large burial mound on an
estate called Sutton Hoo, on the east coast of
England in the area once known as East Anglia
(see map, page 5). The mound was the largest
in a group of earth mounds or barrows that lay
on a steep hundred-foot slope overlooking the
inlet where the River Deben flows into the
North Sea. As the painstaking work continued, the, diggers realized they had uncovered
the richest hoard of early Anglo-Saxon objects
ever found. A jeweled sword, a richly decorated shield and hehnet, gold coins, silver
bowls, and, above all, nineteen pieces of magnificently wrought gold jewelry set with thousands of elaborately cut garnets-these objects
must have been the treasure of a mighty king.
The great gold buckle alone weighs over fourteen ounces. With these objects were found
an iron staridard-frame and a two-foot carved
whetstone, the symbols of sovereignty of an
East Anglian king.
The treasure, scattered and corroded by
time, lay within the hull of what had once
been an eighty-nine-foot wooden ship. Only
the iron bolts and nails remained, but the outline of the ship was plainly visible in the sand.
No trace of a body was found; the ship was

At the evil beast, and his blade drove home
Plated and gleaming. The fire began
To lessen and wane. The king of the Weders
Summoned his wits; he drew the dagger
1625 He wore on his corselet, cutting and keen,
And slit asunder the worm with the blow.
So they felled the foe and wrought their
revenge;
The kinsmen together had killed the dragon.
So a man should be when the need is bitter!

That was the end of his work in the world.
evidently a cenotaph or memorial to a king1
whose bones lay elsewhere. From the evidence
offered by the coins placed with the hoard
-perhaps intended as payment for the ghostly
oarsmen who were to convey the king to the
next world-it is thought that the burial must
have been made between the years A.D. 625 and
660. Ship burials were fairly numerous among
the pagan Vikings of Europe at a later period,
but rare in Anglo-Saxon England. The Sutton
Hoo find was hailed as the most exciting archaeological discovery of the century in Britain.
In August 1939 a local Coroner's Jury was
called upon to decide the legal status of the Sutton Hoo finds-whether they should be considered as treasure-trove and therefore the property of the Crown, or whether they belonged
to Mrs. Pretty, the owner of the Sutton Hoo
estate. If the artifacts had been secretly hidden,
with the intent of recovering them later, they
would become Crown property. But if it could
be shown that they had been publicly buried
1. Some scholars think the king may have been Redwald,
mentioned by Bede in his story of the conversion of King
Edwin (see page 60). Redwald had been converted to
Christianity, but lapsed into pagan practices. This would
account for the combination of Christian and pagan ele•
ments in the cenotaph.

Jie opening section of Beowulf is said to be
• earliest existing documentary evidence of a
• _funeral. But the description of the rich treas that were placed in the ship had generally
• looked upon as poetic fancy. The find at
on Hoo confirmed the historical accuracy of
the Beowulf description of a heroic society rich
in gold and other beautifully wrought objects.
Beowulf may have been composed at a time
when the spectacular Sutton Hoo ship burial was
still remembered. Some scholars even think the
poem may have been intended as a compliment
to a king of East Anglia; there is evidence pointing to the possibility that an ancestor of the East
Anglian royal line was a member of the Geatish
or South Swedish tribe to which Beowulf belonged.
The articles found at Sutton Hoo indicate not
only that Anglo-Saxon culture of the seventh
century was far more advanced than had previously been imagined, but also that the AngloSaxons traded widely. Found on the site were a
Swedish helmet and shield, the blade of a sword
probably forged in the Rhineland, silver bowls
and spoons from the Near East, and gold coins
from France.
Among the objects found at Sutton Hoo
are the Purse-lid, decorated with garnets
and gold; the Buckle· (the heaviest solid
gold object ever found in England); and
the Helmet, here reconstructed from hundreds of corroded iron fragments. 7th century. British Museum

I,
Beowulf's Death
The wound which the dragon had dealt
him began
To swell and burn; and soon he could feel
The baneful venom inflaming his breast.
1635 The wise, old warrior sank down by the wall
And stared at the work of the giants of old,
The arches of stone and the standing
columns
Upholding the ancient earth-hall within.
His loyal thane, the kindest of comrades,
1640 Saw Beowulf bloody and broken in war;
In his hands bore water and bathed his
leader,
And loosened the helm from his dear lord's
head.
Beowulf spoke, though his hurt was sore,
The wounds of battle grievous and grim.
1645 Full well he weened that his life was ended,
And all the joy of his years on earth;
That his days were done, and Death most
near:
"My armor and sword I would leave to my
son
Had Fate but granted, born of my body,
1650 An heir to follow me after I'm gone.
For fifty winters I've ruled this realm,
And never a lord of a neighboring land
Dared strike with terror or seek with sword.
In my life I abode by the lot assigned,
1655 Kept well what was mine, courted no
quarrels,
Swore no false oaths. And now for all this
Though my hurt is grievous, lny heart is
glad.
When life leaves body, the Lord of mankind
Cannot lay to my charge the killing of
kinsmen!
1660 Go quickly, dear Wiglaf, to gaze on the gold
Beneath the hoar stone. The dragon lies still
In the slumber of death, despoiled of his
hoard.
Make haste that my eyes may behold the
treasure,
The gleaming jewels, the goodly store,
1665 And, glad of the gold, more peacefully leave
44 The Anglo-Saxons
The life and the reahn I have ruled so long."
Then Weohstan's son, as they tell the tale,
Clad in his corselet and trappings of war,
Hearkened at once to his wounded lord.
1670 Under roof of the barrow he broke his way.
Proud in triumph he stood by the seat,
Saw glittering jewels and gold on the ground, :
The den of the dragon, the old dawn-flier,
And all the wonders along the walls.
1675 Great bowls and flagons of bygone men
• Lay all unburnished and barren of gems,
Many a hehnet ancient and rusted,
Many an anri-ring cunningly wrought.
Treasure and gold, though hid in the
ground,
1680 Override man's wishes, hide them who will!
High o'er the hoard he beheld a banner,
Greatest of wonders, woven with skill,
All wrought of gold; its radiance lighted
The vasty ground and the glittering
gems ....
1685 As I've heard the tale, the hero unaided
Rifled those riches of giants of old,
The hoard in the barrow, and heaped in his
arms
Beakers and platters, picked what he would
And took the banner, the brightest of
signs ....
1690 In haste returning enriched with spoil.
He feared, and wondered if still he would
find
The lord of the Weders alive on the plain,
Broken and weary and smitten with wounds.
With his freight of treasure he found the
prince,
1695 His dear lord, bloody and nigh unto death.
With water he bathed him till words broke
forth
From the hoard of his heart and, aged and
sad,
Beowulf spoke, as he gazed on the gold:
"For this goodly treasure whereon I gaze
1,00 I give my thanks to the Lord of all,
To the Prince of glory, Eternal God,
Who granted me grace to gain for my people
Such dower of riches before my death.

Then Wiglaf bade tell the tidings of battle
Up over the cliff in the camp of the host
Where the linden-bearers all morning long
1765 Sat wretched in spirit, and ready for both,
The remrn, or the death, of their dear-loved
lord.
Beowulf 45 
Not long did he hide, who rode up the
headland,
The news of their sorrow, but spoke before
all:
"Our leader lies low, the lord of the Weders,
mo The king of the Geats, on the couch of death.
He sleeps his last sleep by the deeds of the
worm.
The dreadful dragon is stretched beside him
Slain with dagger-wounds. Not by the sword
Could he quell the monster or lay him
low ....
1775 Let us go quickly to look on the king
Who brought us treasure, and bear his
corpse
To the funeral pyre. The precious hoard
Shall burn with the hero. There lies the heap
Of untold treasure so grimly gained,
1780 Jewels and gems he bought with his blood
At the end of life. All these at the last
The flames shall veil and the brands devour.
No man for remembrance shall take from the
treasure,
Nor beauteous maiden adorn her breast
1m With gleaming jewel; bereft of gold
And tragic-hearted many shall tread
A foreign soil, now their lord has ceased
From laughter and revel and rapture of joy.
Many a spear in the cold of morning
1790 Shall be borne in hand uplifted on high.
No sound of harp shall waken the warrior,
But the dusky raven despoiling the dead
Shall clamor and cry and call to the eagle
What fare he found at the carrion-feast
1795 The while with the wolf he worried the
corpses.,, . . .
They went with tears to behold the wonder.
They found the friend, who had dealt them
treasure
In former days, on the bed of death,
Stretched out lifeless upon the sand.
1800 They had sighted first, where it lay
outstretched,
The monstrous wonder, the loathsome
worm,
The horrible fire-drake, hideous-hued,
46 The Anglo-Saxons
Scorched with the flame. The spread of its
length
Was fifty foot-measnres! Oft in the night
1805 It sported in air, then sinking to earth
Returned to its den. Now moveless in death
It had seen the last of its earthly lair.
Beside the dragon were bowls and beakers,
Platters lying, and precious swords
1s10 Eaten with rust, where the hoard had rested
A thousand winters in the womb of
earth ....
Then spoke Wiglaf, Weohstan's son:
HQften for one man many must sorrow
As has now befallen the folk of the Geats.
1815 We could not persuade the king by our
counsel,
Our well-loved leader, to shun assault
On the dreadful dragon guarding the gold;
To let him lie where he long had lurked
In his secret lair till the world shall end.
1szo But Beowulf, dauntless, pressed to his
doom ....
Let us haste once more to behold the
treasure,
The gleaming wonders beneath the wall.
I will show the way that you all may see
And closely scan the rings and the gold.
1825 Let the bier be ready, the pyre prepa~ed,
When we come again to carry our lord,
Our leader beloved, where long he shall lie
In the kindly care of the Lord of all."
Beowulf's Funeral
Then the son of Weohstan, stalwart in war,
1830 Bade send command to the heads of homes
To bring from afar the wood for the burning
Where the good king lay: "Now glede8 shall

Then a wagon was loaded with well-wrought

With gleaniing byrnies as Beowulf bade.

Beowulf 47 
With hearts that were heavy they chanted
their sorrow,
Singing a dirge for the death of their lord;
And an aged woman with upbound Jocks
Lamented for Beowulf, wailing in woe.
1870 Over and over she uttered her dread
Of sorrow to come, of bloodshed and
slaughter,
Terror of battle, and bondage, and shame.
The smoke of the bale-fire rose to the sky!
The men of the Weder folk fashioned a
mound
1875 Broad and high on the brow of the cliff,
Seen from afar by seafaring men.
Ten days they worked on the warrior's
barrow
Inclosing the ash of the funeral flame
With a wall as worthy as wisdom could
shape.
1880 They bore to the barrow the rings and the
gems,

The gold to the ground, where it still remains
As useless to men as it was of yore.
1885 Then round the mound rode the brave in
battle,
The sons of warriors, twelve in a band,
Bemoaning their sorrow and mourning their
king.
They sang their dirge and spoke of the hero
Vaunting his valor and venturous deeds.
1890 So is it proper a man should praise
His friendly lord with a loving heart,
When his soul must forth from the fleeting
flesh.
So the folk of the Geats, the friends of his

Bemoaned the fall of their mighty lord;

Mildest, most gentle, most eager for fame.

APPLYING: Foreshadowing li7
See Handbook of Literary Terms, p. 908
When hints or clues in a narrative suggest
events that will occur later, the author is using
the technique of foreshadowing. For example,
when the dragon first attacks Beowulfs people,
the narrator comments:

THINKING SKILLS
Classifying
To classify things is to arrange them into categories or groups according to some system. For
example, writings can be classified as prose or
poetry, and poetry can be further classified as
epic, dramatic, lyric, and so on.
1. Scan Beowulf to find what kinds of personal
possessions are mentioned and classify them
according to purpose ( clothing, adornment,
weapons, and so on.)
2. Classify the characters mentioned by name
in the poem .. Devise your own classifications.
COMPOSITION 49
Defining Beowulf's Heroism
Beowulf is obviously the hero of this poem,
but what makes him a hero? To answer this
question, write an essay of at least four paragraphs in which you define for your fellow smdents what makes an Anglo-Saxon hero and
why Beowulf qualifies as one. Begin by listing
what you think are Beowulf's most significant
traits, and then skim through the poem to find
examples of them. Next outline your essay,
devoting the first paragraph to defining heroism and subsequent paragraphs to describing different heroic characteristics. Support your ideas
with quotes from the poem. See "Writing About
Characters" in the Writer's Handbook.
Explaining Wiglaf's Role in Beowulf
Quite late in his epic, the Beowulf-poet introduces Wiglaf, a new and important character.
Write an essay of at least four paragraphs in
which you explain to other smdents why Wiglaf
is included. First clarify your understanding of
Wiglafs role by going over the scenes in which
he appears, imagining how each would be different if he were absent. Try to figure out why
he is not mentioned earlier. Next outline your
essay, devoting the first paragraph to Wiglafs
first appearance and subsequent paragraphs to
what he does at specific, important moments .
In your concluding paragraph, determine what
impact this .character has on the entire poem.
