ALGERIAI A SETTLER PLANTATION COLONY
Durine the nineteenth centory, France transformed Algeria from an Ottoman territory into a French one. Before the French sent their fleet to Algeria in 1830.
Algeria had been virtually autonomous within the Ottoman Empire, It was ruled by locally chosen Ottoman governors called deys. For most of the Ottoman period. the main source of local revenue came from piracy, By the end of the eighteenth century, however, Mediterranean piracy had seen better days. Not only bad Buropean states become quite adept at projecting their power onto the seas. but they had become increasingly intolerant of what was. In effect. an extor. tion racket practiced by pirates and their North African sponsors.
As revenues from larceny, the ransoming of captives, and the sale of protection to Buropean governments seeking to safeguard their merchants decrensed, the authority of the dey and the dey's government weakened. Around the same time, the French adopted their Mediterranean strategy--the same strategy behind Napoleon's expedition to Egypt. As a matter of fact, although dend for almost a decade, Napoleon was in a way responsible for the French Invasion and colonization of Algeria as well as the Invasion and occupation of Egypt.
While in Egypt, French forces had bought Algerian grain, and the French debt to Algeria remained a sore spot between the two governments for decades afterward. During one particularly grueling round of negotiations about the debt, the exasperated dey of Algeria hit the French consul with a flyswatter, The French government used the famous "fly-whisk incident" to launch a naval campaign against Algeria. The campaign began with a naval blockade and culminated in the French occupation of the Algerian capital, Algiers, in 1830. In 1848, the French integrated Algerin into France as three French d√©partements (prov-inces). In the eyes of the French government, Algeria was France. It remained so for over one hundred years.
European settlers came to Algeria for both political and economic reasons.
The French government used Algeria as a convenient place to dump political dis-sidents, particularly those who had fought in the French Revolution of 1848 or who had participated in the Paris Commune of 1871. But it would have been impossible to build a settler economy with political dissidents alone. During the nineteenth century, the population of southern Europe grew faster than its resource base, cre-nting wide-scale impoverishment. Many from the region emigrated abroad, including numerous southern Italians, who came to the United States. Others--not only French, but Italians and Spanish as well- headed for Algeria.
In addition to impoverished peasants seeking a fresh start beyond the reach of their landlords, workers and artisans from southern Europe were drawn to Algeria by the lure of employment. Prospects for employment were good in Algeria because colonial outposts like Algeria provided lucrative investment opportunities for Europeans during the nineteenth century. Because risk was high and liquidity (the amount of money available locally) low in European colonies, the possibility that European investors would earn a sizable return on their investments was also high.
Money flooded Into those companies that promoted ventures associated with colonial economles. such as the construction of ports, roads, telegraph lines and the like. 'The Algerian rail system dates from 1857 - around the same firne as the ran system in European France. 'These orolects allowed colonizers to open up new areas of Algeria for cash cropping, speed crops to European markets, and maintain control over far reaches of the countryside. 'The construction of such
and semiskilled workers. By the outbreak of World
War 1, there were approximately seven hundred thousand European settlers in Algeria--the vast maloritv of whom had actually been born there. They, rather than the almost five million Muslim Inhabitants of the territory, controlled both political and economic institutions.
To accommodate these settlers and attract European capital to Algeria, the French government seized religious endowments, lands owned by the dey, pasture lands used by nomads, and abandoned urban property, Lands previously held by non-Buropean Inhabitants of Algeria became the property of European speculators and entrepreneurs who consolidated them into plantations for the cultivation of crops bound for the export market--grain, cotton (particularly during the American Civil War), tobacco, even flowers. (Planta-tions are large tracts of land that are devoted to a single crop (monoculture) grown for the market.)
During the 1870s, when a parasite that ate the roots of grapevines virtually decimated the wine industry in France, speculators and entrepreneurs with holdings in Algeria began expanding grape cultivation to take advantage of the short-fall. By 1914, one-third of Algerian exports was wine. The expansion of the plantation system squeezed out European settlers with small landholdings. At the same time, plantation owners hired the indigenous inhabitants of Algeria to work for low wages as seasonal laborers on their plantations. Others who had become landless or who owned plots that were too small for subsistence flocked to cities where they became day laborers or joined the ranks of the unemployed, Overall, then, French imperialism in Algeria encouraged the spread of market relations, disrupted rural life, and increased the population of towns and cities.
The integration of Algeria into the French political and economic system had other effects that no French policymaker could have foreseen in 1830.
French policies in Algeria resembled those of other imperial states elsewhere inasmuch as the French justified their activities by claiming that they brought civilization to the benighted natives--what the French called their civilizing mission (mission civilisatrice). At the same time, however, European settlers and their descendants had access to rights of citizenship that no Muslim Algerian could hope to attain. As we shall discuss in Chapter 13, the integration of Algeria into the "civilized world"-what was, in fact, the integration of Algeria into the modern world economic and state systems=-made the emergence of Algerian nationalism possible: the differentiation between European French citizens and Algerians on the basis of race or language or religion made the emergence of Algerian nationalism likely.`;
