        *Addition 1:<br>
        Multiplying by 10 makes it more accurate for tenths places because the code normally rounds it. If it's
        multiplied
        by 10, then you have to divide the square root by sqrt(10) in the final iteration to counter this. For handling
        hundreths places, multiply by 100 and divide by sqrt(100) at the end and so on. Keep in mind the denominator can
        be
        a pre-calculated constant. Note that the more decimals you account for, the smaller the numbers have to be as if
        you
        account for 20 decimals you're multiplying by 1e20 and so higher numbers can be rounded to Infinity.<br>
        <br>
        **Addition 2:<br>
        It's slightly inaccurate (by at most 1e-9 but usually aroud 1e-16) for the square roots of certain numbers.
        There's also
        no discernable pattern in which numbers it's inaccurate for and increasing the amount of iterations doesn't
        help.
        Increasing the number of decimals handleable in Addition 1 makes it much more accurate for all numbers but can
        have an
        effect on execution time and can limit the size of numbers. Whenever it's slightly inaccurate, Math.sqrt() is
        sometimes also slightly inaccurate which means that the inaccuracy might be caused by the browser.<br>
        <br>
        ***Addition 3:<br>
        In <u>some</u> cases, it's faster than the browser's Math.sqrt() when running both only once (it's seemingly
        random), although when
        running both 10 million times Math.sqrt() is around 100 times faster.<br>
        <br>
        ****Addition 4:<br>
        This is VERY similar to a method of approximating square roots by repeatedly averaging (Newton-Raphson),
        but this is more accurate with less iterations for very small numbers as well as for some normal-sized numbers
        (assuming a₀ is <code>Math.round(Math.sqrt(x))</code> in the Newton-Raphson method and <code>Math.pow(Math.round(Math.sqrt(x*(10**decimals))), 2)
        ^ 0.5</code> in this one).<br>
        <br>
        *****Addition 5:<br>
        By running it once with only the variable x filled in and then setting the decimals to account for in x as
        the iterations needed until it settles, you can reduce the amount of iterations needed as well as sometimes
        increase the accuracy. For whatever reason, this only works if the initial guess's nearest perfect square's
        square root variable is calculated by using
        <code>Math.pow(Math.round(Math.sqrt(x)), 2)^0.5;</code> (^ is XOR, not an exponent), even though it's almost
        always wildly off by a few orders of magnitude.
